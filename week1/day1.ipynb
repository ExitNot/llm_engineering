    "Welcome to the wonderful world of Data Science experimentation! Once you've used Jupyter Lab, you'll wonder how you ever lived without it. Simply click in each \"cell\" with code in it, such as the cell immediately below this text, and hit Shift+Return to execute that cell. As you wish, you can add a cell with the + button in the toolbar, and print values of variables, or try out variations.  \n",

    "I've written a notebook called [Guide to Jupyter](Guide%20to%20Jupyter.ipynb) to help you get more familiar with Jupyter Labs, including adding Markdown comments, using `!` to run shell commands, and `tqdm` to show progress.\n",

Rather, I execute Jupyter Labs, like this, and give you an intuition for what's going on. My suggestion is that you carefully execute this yourself, <b>after</b> watching the lecture. Add print statements to understand what's going on, and then come up with your own variations. If you have a Github account, use this to showcase your variations. Not only is this essential practice, but it demonstrates your skills to others, including perhaps future clients or employers...</span>\n",

We'll do fun things like have LLMs tell jokes and argue with each other. But fundamentally, my goal is to teach skills you can apply in business. I'll explain business implications as we go, and it's worth keeping this in mind: as you build experience with models and techniques, think of ways you could put this into action at work today. Please do contact me if you'd like to discuss more or if you have ideas to bounce off me.</span>\n",

       "A disaster recovery plan is only as good as its last test. This guide walks you through how to design, execute, and evaluate realistic recovery drills‚Äîplus automate them using N2W.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Key Takeaways**\n",
       "\n",
       "* Regular disaster recovery testing and drills are essential to identify and address potential issues before they become actual problems.\n",
       "* A well-crafted disaster recovery plan can differentiate between a quick, safe recovery or prolonged downtime and business continuity risks that can cost your organization millions.\n",
       "* To ensure that your disaster recovery plan is effective, you must develop a comprehensive testing and drill strategy that covers all the critical components of your infrastructure, applications, and processes.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Use Cases**\n",
       "\n",
       "Here are some use cases for data recovery:\n",
       "\n",
       "Use-case #1 - Recovery of Data (AWS and Azure)\n",
       " An organization stores its critical business data in the cloud using AWS and Azure services. A recent cyber attack has caused data corruption and loss, and the organization needs to recover the data as quickly as possible to avoid severe financial and reputational damage.\n",
       "\n",
       "Steps for recovery:\n",
       " Identify the extent of data loss: Organizations should determine the extent and impact of data loss. This may involve analyzing server logs, monitoring systems, and user feedback to identify the scope of the issue.\n",
       " Initiate the data recovery process: The next step is to initiate the data recovery process. AWS and Azure offer different options for recovering data, including backup and restore, replication, and failover. The specific recovery strategy will depend on the nature of the data loss, the backup and recovery options available, and the organization's recovery time objectives (RTO) and recovery point objectives (RPO).\n",
       " Restore data from backups:\n",
       " If backups are available, the organization can restore data from these backups. AWS and Azure offer backup and restore services that allow organizations to create and manage backup copies of their data. These services enable organizations to recover data quickly and easily during data loss.\n",
       "\n",
       "Replicate data:\n",
       " If backups are unavailable or incomplete, the organization can replicate data from other sources. AWS and Azure offer replication services that enable organizations to replicate data across different regions and availability zones to ensure data availability and redundancy.\n",
       " Failure over to secondary systems:\n",
       " If the primary systems are not recoverable, the organization can failover to secondary systems that are geographically dispersed and designed for high availability.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Automation is Not Desired. It's Required**\n",
       "\n",
       "Today, IT systems are expected to be always available and to be recoverable in the event of a disruption. Traditional manual disaster recovery processes are time-consuming, prone to errors, and may not meet the RTOs and RPOs. Automation is a critical component of modern disaster recovery planning.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Test The Plan, Don't Plan The Test**\n",
       "\n",
       "Testing helps identify gaps and weaknesses in the plan, provides an opportunity to refine the plan based on lessons learned, and builds confidence in the recovery process.\n",
       "\n",
       "Regular testing requires:\n",
       " All essential elements, such as hardware, software, networks, and data, should be tested.\n",
       " Noting what went wrong in previous failures for future reference.\n",
       " Updating the disaster recovery plan accordingly."
